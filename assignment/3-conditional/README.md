# Assignment 3 - Conditional instructions
For project three, your objective is to convert the given C++ code into MIPS assembly. Please do not modify the C++ code itself. You are only allowed to make modifications to the assembly file. Start writing your code **below the main: label** and **above the exit: label**. For this project stay BETWEEN these labels.

When doing a C++ to MIPS conversion, the conversion can be done in the following steps:

1. Assign variables to registers. When inspecting code, any constant values in if-statements or expressions may need to be assigned to temporary registers.
2. Initialize variables to registers (actually put the values into the registers).
3. Then move onto the rest of the code.

Before you begin, please make sure to either fork this repository or create a new private repository. Please note that your repository must remain private until after the submission date.

## Expected Output:
* Value of a: 25
* Value of b: 31
* Value of c: 18
* Value of d: 49

## Submission
For submission send link of your repository in ilearn and add me (username **sohe1l**) as a collaborator to your repo. You can read more about adding a collaborator here: [https://help.github.com/en/articles/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository)
When you have completed the assignment please commit all work done to your private repository. This can be done with the following commands:

* git add .
